# Step 5: Regression Analysis Between Genotypes and Phenotypes - Script Outline

A loop was created for each genotype and every phenotype variable column of the filtered dataset. If the data class of the phenotypic variable was of a numerical or integer data type then a linear regression analysis was performed using the lm() function in R, with summary statistics outputted. However, if the data class was of any other data type then a logistic regression was performed using the glm() function, with summary statistics outputted. Both analyses QC checked and performed with rows containing any NA values removed. Throughout the loop several descriptive statistic values were selected and put into a matrix containing 7 columns (containing information regarding: Phenotype name, Phenotype Class, number of unique values used for the analysis, type of regression used, genotype name, beta value and p value).
